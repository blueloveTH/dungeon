# dungeon
 
This repo is a dungeon generation framework for roguelike games (WIP).

## How to develop

First use pure python to dev and test,
then migrate performance-sensitive code to C++.

Also, use the [common feature set](https://reference.pocketpy.dev/python.html) of cpython and pocketpy to maximize compatibility.
